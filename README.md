# Abstract

Electronic Commerce is process of doing business through computer networks. A person sitting on his chair in front of a computer can access all the facilities of the Internet to buy or sell the products.

Specifically, the use of internet in business has enhanced productivity, encouraged greater customer participation, and enabled mass customization, besides reducing costs.

Electronic commerce, commonly written as e-commerce, is the trading or facilitation of
trading in products or services using computer networks, such as the Internet.

Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the
transaction's life cycle, although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail.
